# WebRTC Intro

Friday - 18th of November, 2016.
The new internet Hype is Real-Time connection. When talking about real-time we find ourselves with the following main categories:

- Data sharing
- Video / Audio streaming
- Socket connection for two-way data flow
- Peer2Peer & Peer2Server2Peer connections

To slowly dive into the tech currently available I leaned on Google, StackOverflow, ... classics ... and several articles and tutorials. The following document tries to be a collection of the resources I found most helpful.

**Warning:** This is not a tutorial series and the links are not ordered in a gradual learning curve specific way.
